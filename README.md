This project combines VR and EEG in UE4 relaxing module.

BCI Plugin is included in gitignore file.
You can download it here https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/braincomputerinterface-ue4plugin.

Project should work as relaxing module without plugin, but you will be not able to check your EEG data without it.
