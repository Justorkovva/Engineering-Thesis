This project combines VR and EEG in UE4 relaxing module.

BCI Plugin is included in gitignore file.
You can download it [here](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/braincomputerinterface-ue4plugin).

Project should work as relaxing module without plugin, but you won't be able to check your EEG data without it.

I used Neurosky MindWave Mobile for EEG data and Oculus Rift (it worked on HTC Vive as well).
