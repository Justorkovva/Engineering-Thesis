# Engineering-Thesis
This project combines VR and EEG in UE4 relaxing module.
The scene changes in real time as user relaxation value changes.

I used Neurosky MindWave Mobile for EEG data and Oculus Rift (it worked on HTC Vive as well).

BCI Plugin is included in gitignore file.
You can download it [here](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/braincomputerinterface-ue4plugin).

Project should work as relaxing module without plugin, but you won't be able to check your EEG data without it.

Assets from this project can be found for free on Epic Games Marketplace. Search for:
